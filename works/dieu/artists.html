          <p>Hubert Robert<span> (1733 - 1808)</span></p>
          <p>
            Hubert Robert was a French painter in the school of Romanticism,
            noted especially for his landscape paintings and capricci, or
            semi-fictitious picturesque depictions of ruins in Italy and of
            France.<br /><br />
            The quantity of his work is immense, comprising perhaps one thousand
            paintings and ten thousand drawings. The Louvre alone contains nine
            paintings by his hand and specimens are frequently to be met with in
            provincial museums and private collections.<br /><br />
            Robert's work has more or less of that scenic character which
            justified his selection by Voltaire to paint the decorations of his
            theatre at Ferney.<br /><br />
            His work was much engraved by the abbé de Saint-Non, with whom he
            had visited Naples in the company of Fragonard during his early
            days; in Italy his work has also been frequently reproduced by
            Chatelain, Linard, Le Veau, and others.

          <p>Rembrandt van Rijn<span> (1765 - 1841)</span></p>
          <p>
            Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and
            printmaker.<br /><br />
            An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally
            considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art
            and the most important in Dutch art history.<br /><br />
            In a letter to Huygens, Rembrandt offered the only surviving
            explanation of what he sought to achieve through his art: the
            greatest and most natural movement, translated from de meeste en de
            natuurlijkste beweegelijkheid.<br /><br />
            The word "beweegelijkheid" is also argued to mean "emotion" or
            "motive". Whether this refers to objectives, material or otherwise,
            is open to interpretation; either way, critics have drawn particular
            attention to the way Rembrandt seamlessly melded the earthly and
            spiritual.

          <p>Henry Singleton<span> (1766 – 1839)</span></p>
          <p>
            Henry Singleton was born in London, England, into an artistic
            family.<br />
            He was not yet two years old when his father died, so he was raised
            by his uncle William Singleton, who had studied under the tutelage
            of Ozias Humphry and painted portraits and miniatures.<br /><br />
            Although Singleton, like his uncles and sister, also painted
            miniatures, he did not adhere strictly to the genre.<br /><br />
            He exhibited at the Royal Academy, between 1784 and 1839,
            approximately 300 works, a large proportion of which were portraits,
            with scriptural subjects making up much of the remainder.<br /><br />
            He was for many years the Royal Academy's oldest living
            exhibitor.<br />
            His works were also exhibited at the British Institution from 1806
            and at the Society of British Artists from 1824 until his death in
            1839.

          <p>Charles-Louis Baugniet<span> (1814 – 1886)</span></p>
          <p>
            Charles-Louis Baugniet was a Belgian painter, lithographer and
            aquarellist.<br /><br />
            His name remains attached to the lithographing of portraits of
            famous and lesser-known figures from Belgium, France and England.<br /><br />
            Baugniet settled in Paris in 1860. Almost overnight the invention
            and development of photography strangled the traditional market of
            lithographic portraits, forcing many of Baugniet's colleagues to
            become professional photographers.<br /><br />
            Baugniet however concentrated on producing paintings and portraits
            which displayed the studied elegance of the Second French Empire, a
            genre that enjoyed great popularity.
